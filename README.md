# RecommenderSystemsProject
My code for recommender systems project


Built a user-based movie recommender system in Java that is capable of producing rating predictions for a well-known dataset (Movie Lens).

Designed suitable data structures for storing and manipulating ratings data for collaborative filtering and generated key statistics. 

Implemented different collaborative filtering technique (Distance-Based Similarity, Cosine Similarity, Resnickâ€™s formula) to make predictions and evaluated prediction performance by implementing leave-one-out (L1O) testing.
